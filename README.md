## Files & Folders Explained

### `node_modules/`

Where npm stores all installed packages. Don’t modify this manually.
(Automatically generated when running `npm install`) ([GeeksforGeeks][1])

---

### `public/`

Serves **static assets** such as images, CSS, and client-side JavaScript. Files here can be accessed directly from the browser. ([GeeksforGeeks][2])

---

### `src/` – Source Code Directory

Contains all the core backend logic of your application:

* **`controllers/`** – Route handlers: functions that take requests, process data (often via services/models), and send responses. Keeps your routes clean. ([GeeksforGeeks][2])

* **`routes/`** – Defines your URL endpoints and links them to controller functions. Keeps routing organized and readable. ([LogRocket Blog][3], [GeeksforGeeks][2])

* **`models/`** – Database schemas or models (e.g., Mongoose models). Defines how data is structured and validates it. ([GeeksforGeeks][2])

* **`services/`** – Business logic lives here—complex operations separated from request handling, making controllers simpler and code more reusable. ([Codemzy][4], [Medium][5])

* **`middleware/`** – Functions that intercept requests (like authentication or error handling) before they reach your controllers. ([GeeksforGeeks][2])

* **`configs/`** – Centralizes configuration logic (like database credentials or environment-specific settings), making it easier to manage and change. ([GeeksforGeeks][2], [Medium][6])

* **`app.js`** – Sets up your Express app, including middleware and routing. It’s imported and started in `server.js`. ([Medium][6])

---

### `server.js`

The entry point of your application. It loads `src/app.js`, connects any necessary services, and starts the HTTP server on a specified port. Clean separation keeps startup logic separate from app configuration. ([Medium][6])

---

### `package.json`

Holds metadata such as project name, scripts, and dependencies. Essential for installing, versioning, and running your app. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])

---

### `.env`

Stores environment-specific configurations (e.g., ports, database URLs, API keys). Keeps sensitive information out of your code. Load variables into `process.env` using `dotenv` or Node.js’s built-in `--env-file` support. ([Medium][7], [Phil Nash][8], [DEV Community][9])
As one developer on Reddit put it:

> “Environment-based config for deployments… helps minimize exposure of secrets… eases scaling.” ([Reddit][10])

---

### `.gitignore`

Specifies files or folders to exclude from version control. Common entries:

```
node_modules/
.env
```

Keeps unnecessary files and secrets out of your Git repo. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])

---

## Why a Structured Layout Matters

A well-organized structure:

* Enhances **readability and navigation**—anyone can quickly find where logic lives.
* Makes the codebase **easier to maintain and scale**, letting you grow features without confusion.
* Encourages **modularization and DRY principles**, promoting reusable logic and reducing duplication. ([Medium][5])
* Particularly helpful for **team collaboration**, ensuring all developers share the same expectations. ([LogRocket Blog][3], [Medium][5])

## Example README Entry

You could include this in your `README.md`:

```markdown
### Project Structure

- `node_modules/`: Installed npm packages (ignore manually).
- `public/`: Static assets like CSS, JS, images for the client.
- `src/`
  - `controllers/`: Handle incoming requests, call services/models, return responses.
  - `routes/`: Define API endpoints and assign controllers.
  - `models/`: Define data schemas and validation logic.
  - `services/`: Business logic and operations that interface with models.
  - `middleware/`: Shared functions like auth or error handling.
  - `configs/`: Environment-specific settings and DB configs.
  - `app.js`: Initialize Express, middleware, and routes.
- `server.js`: Launches the app by loading Express setup and starting the server.
- `package.json`: Project configuration, dependencies, and scripts.
- `.env`: Stores sensitive or environment-specific variables.
- `.gitignore`: Lists files/folders for Git to ignore, e.g., `node_modules/`, `.env`.

**Why this structure?** It makes the project scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand—especially as your app grows or when working with others.
